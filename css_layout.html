            Why AngularJS?
           HTML is great for declaring static documents, but it falters when we try to use it for declaring dynamic views in web-applications. AngularJSlets you extend HTML vocabulary for your application. The resulting environment is extraordinarily expressive, readable, and quick to develop.

           Alternatives
         Other frameworks deal with HTML’s shortcomings by either abstracting away HTML, CSS, and/or JavaScript or by providing an imperative way for manipulating the DOM. Neither of these address the root problem that HTML was not designed for dynamic views.
       Extensibility
          AngularJS is a toolset for building the framework most suited to your application development. It is fully extensible and works well with other libraries. Every feature can be modified or replaced to suit your unique development workflow and feature needs. Read on to find out how.

            Declarative
              React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes.
            Declarative views make your code more predictable and easier to debug.
                Component-Based
              Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs.
            Since component logic is written in JavaScript instead of templates, you can easily pass rich data through your app and keep state out of the DOM.
           Learn Once, Write Anywhere
           We don’t make assumptions about the rest of your technology stack, so you can develop new features in React without rewriting existing code.

               React can also render on the server using Node and power mobile apps using React Native.
